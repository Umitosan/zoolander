# _Zoolander_

#### By _**Dominic Brown**_

#### Independent project @ Epicodus - 6/9/17

## Description

The local zoo is a mess due to mismanagement.  Luckily, they have me to help by organizing the chaos and building a new app for tracking their animals.  The app will aid the staff by allowing the storing and sorting of animals in new ways.

## User stories

* I want to be able to add newly-admitted animals to the app.
* I want to log a newly-admitted animal by submitting a form with animal species, name, age,  diet, zoo location, number of needed caretakers, sex, one like and one dislike.
* I want to view a list of animals I have logged.
* I want options to view all animals, only young animals (less than 2 years of age), or only mature animals (more than 2 years of age).
* I want to click an animal to edit its name, age or caretakers.
